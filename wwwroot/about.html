    <h1>What?</h1>
    <p>When playing games with a wide range of items/characters/weapons to level up I always look forward to completing challenges. It lots of games there is sometimes a 'Nearest to completion' section which displays which item/character/weapon is close to a level up. I decided that this would be   my influence for my web site so that a user can see how far until their favorite champion levels up. How far they are from all champions of a certain type being a certain level and much more.</p>
    <p>I have created 'MasteryMaster' as a site which users can enter their 'League of Legends'' summoner name to view all their information on each champion, how close to a level up they are and compare themselves against their friends. The information is displayed and can be order or filtered based on multiple different criteria. MasteryMaster also contain achievements that users can attempt to complete and compare their overall score with friends.</p>
    <h1>Why?</h1>
    <p>This site was created as part of the Riot Games API Challenge 2016. The challenge was to create an application which utilised the 'Champion Mastery' information from Riot's APIs and 
        create something either innovative, entertaining or useful.
    </p>
    <h1>How?</h1>
    <p>To create this application I began with creating a NodeJS application which would behave as my 'backend server' and also serve my 'front end website'. The server provides secure access to the Riot Games APIs where the information on a summoners champion mastery data is available. The backend server will then communicate with the front end website to display this information to the user and allow filtering and ordering.</p>
    <p>The front end website was created using bootstrap and angularJS to display information and perform queries on the data. A router was used to seperate the functionality of each page but allow data and information to be shared across the application</p>
    <h1>What Next?</h1>
    <p>In the future changes would be made to increase the amount of available achievements, include a compare tab where players could compare themselves against their friends in great depth and also add features to share achievements and champion mastery information on social networks such as Facebook or Twitter.</p>
